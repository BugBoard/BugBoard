# Contributors
Many thanks to those who take the time to contribute to this project! This project has the ambitious goal of identifying and analyzing real-world events to help new developers in the tough transition from students to experienced practitioners- all in public view and with real software that people actually use. Each contribution helps us towards the goal of providing a useful repository of software engineering knowledge for upcoming developers worldwide, entirely free of charge.

## Project Contributors
These people have made material contributions to how the BugBoard works, whether through guidance to contributors, work on the core format and cataloging of the analyses, extensive review of incoming pull requests, or work organizing and leading the community.

### [Casey Doran](http://github.com/elementc)
Casey Doran is a flight software engineer at a reusable rocket company you've heard of, working on a project to create a reasonably-priced megaconstellation of satellites to provide global internet for cheaper than you're paying now. He grew up in Cape Canaveral, Florida, where he saw many rockets launch and, occasionally, land. He studied Software Engineering and earned his B.Sc. in 2015 and M.Sc. in 2017 at the Florida Institute of Technology, teaching courses in introductory and advanced software engineering, advanced software testing, legal, ethical, and social issues in computing, and fundamentals of programming along the way.

## Analysis Contributors
These people have made contributions of their time and expertise to help pull the software engineering story out of each analyzed bug report, often spending hours of their valuable leisure time explaining and documenting a fault in a piece of software they likely never wrote.

## Link Contributors
While these people may not have done much software engineering themselves, they go beyond readers of these documents and make a point to seek out new and interesting software faults, identify gaps in this knowledge base, and contribute helpful examples for further analysis and dissemination among the community.
