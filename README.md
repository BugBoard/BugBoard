# BugBoard
A board of fascinating bugs from across open source, collected to help new software engineers learn about how software fails and what we can learn from when it does.

## Suggested Bugs
These are just links for now. If you have an interesting bug report to share, please feel free add it below! See the Contribute section at the bottom if you need pointers.

## Analyzed Bugs
These are detailed analyses of bugs written and peer reviewed by practitioners of software engineering. They follow a specific [template](template.md) designed to help frame the external bug report for non-practitioners as a story about how software engineering processes work- and sometimes don't work.

  * None yet! Please feel free to contribute some!

## Contribute to the BugBoard
It starts as just a list, this is the easiest to contribute. Get a link to an interesting bug and add it to the list below. Just hit edit in the top right or [click here](https://github.com/BugBoard/BugBoard/edit/master/README.md), add your link, and submit it as a pull request!

If you want to seriously contribute to the Board, and know how to use Git, feel free to submit an analysis of one of linked bugs as a standalone report. Fill out a copy of the report template and link it in the appropriate section (remove old links to external trackers if need be!), then submit it as a pull request to this project. Be sure to add yourself as a contributor any analyses you help with and also to the project-wide list of contributors in [contributors.md](contributors.md)
